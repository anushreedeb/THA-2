THA 1.ipynb is the final output python file which contains the merged state names as the final output from the previous assignment. In order to attain that, the following 3 files which have been uploaded in Github should be downloaded. Run the code written in THA-1.ipynb and the result should be a merged dataset. Below is information on the files and their description. Codenames within the specific files have been listed: 

* The **Census**, **DHS** and **IHSDS** files contain information on various state names in India along with other variables. The objective was to list and find the names of common states in India and those names have been merged into a table. 


* [Census](http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/population_enumeration.html): "State" refers to the list of states in India 
* [IHDS](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/36151/summary): "STATEID" refers to the list of states in India 
* [DHS](https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/dataset_admin/index.cfm): "hv024" refers to the list of states in India 


**Final Project Questions**
* For my final project, I would like to look at how different datasets paint different pictures and scenarios of the country and how that impacts decision making. For example, differences in how housing shortage and affordability is measured will impact housing and infrastructure policies. Additionally, ease of dataset accessibility is another crucial factor in replicability and understanding.
